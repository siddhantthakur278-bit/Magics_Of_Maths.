# Math Tricks Web App

This is a small interactive web project that shows different fun math tricks.  
You can pick any trick from the sidebar, read the steps, and try it using the input box.  
The page shows the output and explanation depending on which trick you select.

## Features

- Easy to add more tricks later

## How It Works
The project mainly has three parts:

### 1. **HTML**
Handles the layout structure — sidebar, main content area, and a canvas for animation.

### 2. **CSS**
Contains colors, glow effects, layout spacing, and general styling.  
The design is still basic and can be improved anytime.

### 3. **JavaScript**
Controls:
- Switching between tricks  
- Running each trick based on user input  
- Updating the result dynamically  
- A simple particle animation for the background

Each trick has its own function (like `runTrick1()`).
